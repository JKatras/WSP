		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The intent of this project is to redesign the website for Kirkman Road 
		Veterinary Clinic (hosted at mykrvc.com).  The current design does highlight some
		 important features, such as services offered, a link to schedule 
		appointments, and information about the clinic, but this content is overwhelmed
		by decorative content.  An excess number of images causes long page load-times,
		 even with a high-speed connection.  The .html on the home page alone exceeds 
		 330 lines, though there were a dozen validation errors.  The global navigation 
		 has redundant links, 4 out of 6 of which could be contained under one (Contact 
		 Us).</p>
		<p>The redesign will cut down on excess images and code to improve load times.  
		Navigation will be condensed to more essential features and will place more 
		emphasis on appointment scheduling, services offered, and what separates Kirkman
		Road from their local competition.  The current design offers the user several 
		sharing options to external sites, though they don't seem relevant to the content
		presented (i.e. StumbleUpon, Reddit, Digg).  A redesign will simplify content and
		utilize relevant external links, such as customers who want Facebook and Twitter
		updates.</p>
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
		<p>There is little data available about KRVC's site statistics on Alexa.com.
		The site is ranked #13,170,428 in global traffic.  The average user views 1.5 
		pages per visit.  Given the large number of pages on the site, they don't seem to
		be holding the visitor's attention.  Or, the data could imply that the user is not
		quickly finding what they need due to excess content.  A reduction in the number
		of pages and a narrower focus should make navigation simple and encourage more
		browsing of the content that is available.</p>

		<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
		<p><strong>User Persona A:</strong> Tanya is a mother of two and owns a cat and
		dog.  She has an Associate's Degree, has been married twelve years, and has 
		recently started using the web to research businesses instead of the yellow pages.
		  Tanya is very attached to her pets and has owned several in her lifetime.  She 
		does not spare expenses when it comes to the health of her animals.</p>
		<p><strong>User Persona B:</strong> Andy is a middle-income single dog-owner and 
		very comfortable navigating the web.  He knows how to shop around for exactly what
		he's looking for.  He prefers being able to complete most transactions online 
		instead of in-person or via phone.</p>
