		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The intent of this project is to redesign the website for Kirkman Road 
		Veterinary Clinic (hosted at mykrvc.com).  The current design does highlight some
		 important features, such as services offered, a link to schedule 
		appointments, and information about the clinic, but this content is overwhelmed
		by decorative content.  An excess number of images causes long page load-times,
		 even with a high-speed connection.  The .html on the home page alone exceeds 
		 330 lines.  The global navigation has redundant links, 4 out of 6 of which could
		be contained under one (Contact Us).</p>
		<p>The redesign will cut down on excess images and code to improve load times.  
		Navigation will be condensed to more essential features and will place more 
		emphasis on appointment scheduling, services offered, and what separates Kirkman
		Road from their local competition.</p>
